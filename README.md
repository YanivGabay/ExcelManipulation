so:
creating the first msg,in the exact format,and with the proper name: "format_+CurrDate".

we need to work with hebrew letters and general utf.

first step:
look at example of gui flow:
work on the second part first, to recive a text file from driving minstiry

"to_dfus_date" - which date is formatted: 010124
